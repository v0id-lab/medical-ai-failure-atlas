## Relationships

### Clinical State Language to Clinical Trajectory Engine

trajectory rows contain ordered clinical state records

### Clinical Trajectory Engine to Medical Reasoning Verifier

verifier scores the trace against state change and missing data

### Medical Reasoning Verifier to Agentic Medicine Sandbox

sandbox actions must pass reasoning and boundary gates

### Multilingual Medical Intelligence to Clinical State Language

language context is a first class state field

### Medical Intelligence Atlas to all layers

each layer exposes build targets, validators, and blockers

## Release States

### ready

synthetic data, validator, and boundary text pass

### blocked

missing validator, missing source support, or forbidden claim

### needs source check

public claim depends on external source verification

## Validation Command

`make medical_intelligence_atlas`
