# Medical Intelligence Atlas v0.1

Date: 2026 06 25

Status: repo construction map

## Purpose

Turn Clinical Intelligence Stack from documents into connected build targets with data, validators, risk gates, and next implementation steps.

## Global Boundaries

1. No patient data
2. No clinical validation claim
3. No clinical deployment claim
4. No diagnosis or treatment instruction
5. No model ranking claim
6. No partner or institutional support claim

Next build: deterministic verifier fixture rows

### mia_mrv_002 Medical Reasoning Verifier

Artifact: source support gate

Input: claim and source support note

Output: supported, partial, or unsupported status

Validator: claim support field cannot be empty

Artifact: agent event protocol

Input: synthetic agent event

Output: safe next event candidates

Validator: agent role and action boundary check

Risk gate: patient, clinician, test, source, consultant, and follow up roles must stay separate

Next build: event protocol validator

### mia_ams_002 Agentic Medicine Sandbox

Artifact: tool use boundary map

Input: synthetic tool call request

Output: allowed, blocked, or needs human review

Validator: tool call cannot create patient data, payment, or clinical deployment claim

Risk gate: unclear tool action defaults to blocked

Next build: blocked action fixture set

### mia_mmi_001 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: language context lock

Input: English and Turkish synthetic clinical wording

Output: language context and ambiguity flags

Validator: language context field must be explicit

Risk gate: translation must not add clinical certainty

Next build: paired state drift regression set

### mia_mmi_002 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: plain clinical language gate

Input: synthetic public explanation

Output: plain language review status, local drift triage report, cross language ambiguity report, negation audience report, scope anchor report, temporal progression report, uncertainty calibration report, source support scope reconciliation report, and source recency applicability report

Validator: public wording cannot give diagnosis or treatment instruction, and rewrite plus cross language reports must remain local fixture only

Risk gate: public wording must separate education from care

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_mmi_003 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: cross language negation and audience role controls

Input: synthetic Turkish English negation and audience role control rows

Output: negation inversion and audience role drift report

Validator: negation and audience role report must remain local fixture only and must block role shift or warning inversion signals

Risk gate: translation must not invert warnings or shift who is being addressed

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_mmi_004 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: cross language scope anchor controls

Input: synthetic Turkish English scope anchor control rows

Output: scope anchor drift report

Validator: scope anchor report must remain local fixture only and must block missing variable erasure, actor role change, action boundary drift, or local context detachment

Risk gate: translation must not detach missing variables, actor role, action boundary, or local context from the same record

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_mmi_005 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: cross language temporal progression controls

Input: synthetic Turkish English temporal progression control rows

Output: temporal progression drift report

Validator: temporal progression report must remain local fixture only and must block duration shift, sequence reversal, follow up timing removal, interval precision loss, or care instruction creation

Risk gate: translation must not shift duration, reverse sequence, remove follow up timing, lose interval precision, or create care instructions

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_mmi_006 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: cross language uncertainty calibration controls

Input: synthetic Turkish English uncertainty calibration control rows

Output: uncertainty calibration drift report

Validator: uncertainty calibration report must remain local fixture only and must block confidence inflation, uncertainty marker removal, evidence gap closure, reviewer state downgrade, or confidence score creation

Risk gate: translation must not inflate confidence, remove uncertainty, close unresolved evidence, downgrade reviewer state, or create confidence scores

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_mmi_007 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: cross language source support scope reconciliation controls

Input: synthetic Turkish English source support scope reconciliation control rows

Output: source support scope reconciliation drift report

Validator: source support scope reconciliation report must remain local fixture only and must block source scope broadening, claim source mapping drift, source limit removal, unsupported source authority creation, or cross language source scope detachment

Risk gate: translation must not broaden source support needs, misalign claim source maps, remove source limits, invent source authority, or detach source scope across languages

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_mmi_008 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: cross language source recency and applicability controls

Input: synthetic Turkish English source recency and applicability control rows

Output: source recency and applicability drift report

Validator: source recency applicability report must remain local fixture only and must block source date shift, recency status inflation, population broadening, setting broadening, or applicability limit removal

Risk gate: translation must not shift source date, inflate recency status, broaden population or setting, or remove applicability limits

Next build: cross language source conflict and provenance controls

### mia_atlas_001 Medical Intelligence Atlas

Artifact: node registry

Input: stack node definition

Output: buildable node with validator and risk gate

Validator: each node needs input, output, validator, risk gate, and next build

Risk gate: a node without a test path is not ready

Next build: atlas coverage dashboard

### mia_atlas_002 Medical Intelligence Atlas

Artifact: release readiness map

Input: node registry and validation logs

Output: ready, blocked, or needs source check

Validator: release state must name blocker or exact next action

Risk gate: public release cannot outrun validators

Next build: machine readable release gate

## Relationships

### Clinical State Language to Clinical Trajectory Engine

trajectory rows contain ordered clinical state records

### Clinical Trajectory Engine to Medical Reasoning Verifier

verifier scores the trace against state change and missing data

### Medical Reasoning Verifier to Agentic Medicine Sandbox

sandbox actions must pass reasoning and boundary gates

### Multilingual Medical Intelligence to Clinical State Language

language context is a first class state field

### Medical Intelligence Atlas to all layers

each layer exposes build targets, validators, and blockers

## Release States

### ready

synthetic data, validator, and boundary text pass

### blocked

missing validator, missing source support, or forbidden claim

### needs source check

public claim depends on external source verification

## Validation Command

`make medical_intelligence_atlas`
