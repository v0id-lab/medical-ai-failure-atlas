Risk gate: MMI 135 chain closure packets cannot imply patient data use, clinical advice, authority, clearance, publication readiness, clinical validation, clinical deployment, model ranking, model superiority, partner approval, institutional backing, regulatory approval, or clinical use clearance

Next build: MMI 136 chain archive controls

### mia_mmi_136 Multilingual Medical Intelligence

Artifact: MMI 136 chain archive controls

Input: MMI 135 closure reviewed archived packets

Output: chain archive review packet with source closeout id, exported ledger row id, owner final state, dissent note, unresolved branch archive boundary, archive snapshot, and reopenability preserved

Validator: each MMI 136 chain archive control must preserve source closeout id, exported ledger row id, owner final state, dissent note, unresolved branch archive boundary, archive snapshot, and reopenability or block the archive packet

Risk gate: MMI 136 chain archive packets cannot imply patient data use, clinical advice, authority, clearance, publication readiness, clinical validation, clinical deployment, model ranking, model superiority, partner approval, institutional backing, regulatory approval, or clinical use clearance

Next build: MMI 137 chain reuse controls

### mia_atlas_001 Medical Intelligence Atlas

Artifact: node registry

Input: stack node definition

Output: buildable node with validator and risk gate

Validator: each node needs input, output, validator, risk gate, and next build

Risk gate: a node without a test path is not ready

Next build: atlas coverage dashboard

### mia_atlas_002 Medical Intelligence Atlas

Artifact: release readiness map

Input: node registry and validation logs

Output: ready, blocked, or needs source check

Validator: release state must name blocker or exact next action

Risk gate: public release cannot outrun validators

Next build: machine readable release gate

## Relationships

### Clinical State Language to Clinical Trajectory Engine

trajectory rows contain ordered clinical state records

### Clinical Trajectory Engine to Medical Reasoning Verifier

verifier scores the trace against state change and missing data

### Medical Reasoning Verifier to Agentic Medicine Sandbox

sandbox actions must pass reasoning and boundary gates

### Multilingual Medical Intelligence to Clinical State Language

language context is a first class state field

### Medical Intelligence Atlas to all layers

each layer exposes build targets, validators, and blockers

## Release States

### ready

synthetic data, validator, and boundary text pass

### blocked

missing validator, missing source support, or forbidden claim

### needs source check

public claim depends on external source verification

## Validation Command

`make medical_intelligence_atlas`
