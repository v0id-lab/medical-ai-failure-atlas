# Reviewer question public contributor digest v0.1

Status: generated public preview.

Date: 2026 06 17

This digest gives contributors a short orientation path for using the reviewer question release index before opening or updating a synthetic SourceCheckup or Failure Atlas issue.

It is not clinical advice, not patient data, not raw model output release, not clinical deployment, not clinical validation, not a benchmark compatibility claim, not a benchmark equivalence claim, not a score report, not a model ranking, not an endpoint result, and not an official endorsement.
