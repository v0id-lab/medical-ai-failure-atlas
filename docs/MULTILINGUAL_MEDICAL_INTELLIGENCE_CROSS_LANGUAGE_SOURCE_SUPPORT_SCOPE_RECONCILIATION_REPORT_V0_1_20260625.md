# Multilingual Medical Intelligence Cross Language Source Support Scope Reconciliation Controls v0.1

Date: 2026 06 25

Status: ready for local repo review only

## Purpose

This report checks whether English and Turkish ASCII variants preserve the claim source support map, source support needs, source limits, and source scope across the same record.

It blocks cross language source support scope reconciliation drift when one language broadens a source support need, misaligns the claim source map, removes source limits, invents unsupported source authority, or detaches source scope across languages.

It keeps source support scope, source row identity, claim limits, and reviewer hold attached to the same synthetic source record.

The controls use synthetic rows only. They contain no patient data and make no diagnosis, treatment instruction, clinical validation, clinical deployment, model ranking, partner, or institutional claim.

## Score Summary

1. Control rows: 12.
2. Expected pass controls: 6.
3. Expected fail controls: 6.
4. Observed pass controls: 6.
5. Observed blocked controls: 6.
6. Source candidate coverage count: 6.
7. Source row coverage count: 6.

## Cross Language Signal Counts

1. `english_source_scope_broadened`: declared 1, detected 1.
2. `turkish_source_scope_broadened`: declared 1, detected 1.
3. `claim_source_mapping_misaligned`: declared 1, detected 1.
4. `source_limit_removed`: declared 1, detected 1.
5. `unsupported_source_authority_created`: declared 1, detected 1.
6. `cross_language_source_scope_detached`: declared 1, detected 1.

## Reviewer Triage

Does either language broaden a source support need, misalign a claim to source map, remove source limits, invent unsupported source authority, or detach source scope across languages.

Triage order:

1. `english_source_scope_broadened`
2. `turkish_source_scope_broadened`
3. `claim_source_mapping_misaligned`
4. `source_limit_removed`
5. `unsupported_source_authority_created`
6. `cross_language_source_scope_detached`

## Release Boundary

This report supports repo local review only. It does not clear text for patient care, clinical advice, translation clearance, source support scope clearance, clinical validation, clinical deployment, model comparison, institutional use, or external publication.

Boundary note: not score certification, not source truth certification, not clinical validation, not clinical deployment, not translation clearance, not source support scope clearance, and not external publication clearance.

## Validation Command

`make multilingual_medical_intelligence_cross_language_source_support_scope_reconciliation_controls`

Direct check:

`python3 scripts/score_multilingual_medical_intelligence_cross_language_source_support_scope_reconciliation_controls_v0_1_20260625.py --check`

## Exact Next Action

Add cross language source conflict and provenance controls so translated variants preserve source conflict status, source version, and provenance chain before public reuse.
