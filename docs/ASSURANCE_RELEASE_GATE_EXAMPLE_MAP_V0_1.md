# Assurance release gate example map v0.1

Status: generated public preview.

Date: 2026 06 16

This map turns the assurance card template into concrete release gate examples. It connects clinician literacy lessons, Turkish synthetic risk rows, SourceCheckup queue rows, assurance card sections, and public action boundaries.

It uses synthetic examples only. It is not clinical advice, not patient data, not clinical deployment, not clinical validation, not a model safety claim, not a model ranking, not source truth certification, not regulatory approval, and not an official endorsement.

Release gate levels: L3, L4, L5

Release gate decision: blocked_clinical_deployment

Minimum required review: explicit Goktug clearance before any external pilot language

Main blocker: official role, sandbox access, pilot, and deployment claims are blocked

Allowed public phrase: public evaluation infrastructure example

Blocked public phrase: official sandbox role or deployment readiness claim

Track A value: Turkish national route wording gate for sandbox readiness without access claims.

Track B value: Open source release boundary example for public medical AI infrastructure.

## Boundary checks

1. Every example uses synthetic examples only.
2. Patient data is not used.
3. Local validation does not mean clinical truth, source truth, model safety, or deployment readiness.
4. L4 external pilot language requires separate explicit clearance.
5. Assurance gate L5 remains blocked in this automation.
6. Official role, sandbox access, clinical deployment, clinical validation, and model safety claims remain blocked.
