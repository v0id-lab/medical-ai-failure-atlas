## Reproducible checks

Run:

```bash
make validate
make case_intake
make taxonomy_dashboard
make tr_medllm_pack
make tr_medllm_specialty_spread
make tr_medllm_specialty_dashboard
make clinician_review_queue
make clinician_literacy_map
make source_claim_queue
make health_data_quality_card
make boundary_notes
make assurance_card_template
make assurance_release_gate_map
make sourcecheckup_tr_medllm_routing
make source_review_worksheets
make red_flag_warning_checklist
make red_flag_contributor_examples
make warning_sign_role_table
make sourcecheckup_contrib_v02
make sourcecheckup_public_issue
make sourcecheckup_expansion_dashboard
make platform_dashboard
make leaderboard_report
```

These commands check public data boundaries, generate public reports, validate synthetic review rows, and keep the release away from patient data, raw model outputs, model ranking, and clinical claims.

## Track A value

For Türkiye health AI safety infrastructure, this public preview gives a concrete clinician led foundation for:

1. Turkish medical LLM safety cases.
2. Review gates before any sandbox or workflow discussion.
3. Clinician AI literacy examples.
4. Source support discipline.
5. Health data privacy and provenance boundaries.
6. Source claim review queue for Turkish medical language model examples.
7. Data quality and label audit card for synthetic release readiness.
8. Boundary notes that separate benchmark mapping from compatibility or endorsement claims.
9. Assurance card template for intended use, risk, source support, human review, and release gate boundaries.
10. SourceCheckup public contributor issue route for synthetic Turkish medical language model source claim review examples.
11. Six platform dashboard index that connects Turkish benchmark, assurance, literacy, source review, failure atlas, and data quality surfaces.
12. TR MedLLM specialty spread dashboard for Turkish clinical domain, risk axis, release gate, and SourceCheckup routing coverage.
13. SourceCheckup expansion dashboard that blocks medication, benchmark wording, national route wording, and data provenance source claims until exact support checks are complete.
14. Clinician literacy release gate lesson map that turns 14 Turkish medical language model rows and 12 SourceCheckup rows into six public training lessons.
15. Assurance release gate example map that turns six clinician literacy lessons into model card, risk card, data card, source card, human review, audit trail, and public action gates.
16. SourceCheckup TR MedLLM assurance routing map that connects 12 source claim queue rows, 14 Turkish synthetic risk rows, and six assurance release gate examples.
17. Source review worksheets that turn medication safety and policy wording routes into concrete public review questions.
18. Red flag source locator and warning sign checklist that turns false reassurance, rare danger, and source locator risks into public review steps.
19. Red flag source locator contributor examples that turn unsafe red flag wording into SourceCheckup contribution rows.
20. Warning sign reviewer role table that assigns clinician, source locator, warning sign wording, and adjudication roles.

This does not claim official status, program participation, regulatory access, sandbox access, or institutional endorsement.

## Track B value

For global open source medical AI evaluation, this public preview gives:

1. A reusable failure taxonomy.
2. A synthetic intake contract.
3. A generated review queue.
4. A SourceCheckup contribution path.
5. A no ranking report path.
6. A visible foundation for collaboration with benchmark and model builder communities.
7. A source claim review queue that separates citation presence from evidence support.
8. A data quality and label audit checklist for synthetic dataset release readiness.
9. Boundary notes for MedHELM and Medmarks oriented mapping without compatibility claims.
10. A reusable assurance card template for public medical language model evaluation releases.
11. A public SourceCheckup contributor issue route for synthetic source claim review examples.
12. A public dashboard entry point that links the six seed platforms and their runnable checks.
13. A generated specialty spread dashboard for multilingual medical AI safety benchmark growth.
14. A generated SourceCheckup expansion dashboard that turns source support, benchmark wording, policy wording, and provenance checks into a public review surface.
15. A clinician literacy lesson map that connects Failure Atlas, TR MedLLM, SourceCheckup, assurance gates, and clinician review states.
16. A generated assurance release gate map that connects public examples to assurance card sections and release gate levels.
17. A generated SourceCheckup TR MedLLM assurance routing map that links source surfaces, risk axes, release gate levels, and blocked public wording.
18. Source review worksheets for medication safety and policy wording without source truth certification or clinical claims.
19. Red flag warning checklists for partial negative evidence, symptom fluctuation, and source locator triage claims.
20. Red flag contributor examples for PMID locator misuse, broad source reassurance, and warning sign placement.
21. Escalation gate audit rows for partial negative evidence, symptom fluctuation, source locator triage claims, public wording boundaries, and reviewer disagreement.

This does not claim benchmark equivalence, clinical validation, or model superiority.

## Next public build gates

1. Label audit reviewer role table and escalation gate audit rows.
2. External maintainer issue draft only after exact owner clearance.
3. Model run plan files only after endpoint terms and cost are explicitly cleared.
