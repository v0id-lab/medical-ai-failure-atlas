# Public infrastructure release note v0.1

Date: 2026 06 16

Status: public preview.

This release note summarizes the public medical AI evaluation infrastructure now visible in this repository.

It is not clinical advice, not patient data, not clinical deployment, not clinical validation, not a model safety claim, not a model ranking, not a regulatory claim, and not an institutional or national program endorsement.

## What is now inspectable

1. Failure Atlas public taxonomy.
2. Failure Atlas case intake workflow.
3. SourceCheckup Medical source review workflow.
4. No ranking synthetic report design.
5. TR MedLLM synthetic risk pack.
6. Clinician review queue.
7. Contribution templates for synthetic cases and source review.
8. Public roadmap for the next build steps.
9. Clinician review protocol v0.1.
10. Source claim review queue v0.1.

## Current public coverage

1. 13 synthetic intake rows.
2. 8 Turkish synthetic risk rows.
3. 8 risk axes.
4. 10 of 10 Failure Atlas taxonomy pattern IDs represented.
5. 13 clinician review queue rows.
6. 2 source review rows.
7. 6 public review states.
8. 8 source claim review queue rows.

## Reproducible checks

Run:

```bash
make validate
make case_intake
make taxonomy_dashboard
make tr_medllm_pack
make clinician_review_queue
make source_claim_queue
make sourcecheckup_contrib_v02
make leaderboard_report
```

These commands check public data boundaries, generate public reports, validate synthetic review rows, and keep the release away from patient data, raw model outputs, model ranking, and clinical claims.

## Track A value

For Türkiye health AI safety infrastructure, this public preview gives a concrete clinician led foundation for:

1. Turkish medical LLM safety cases.
2. Review gates before any sandbox or workflow discussion.
3. Clinician AI literacy examples.
4. Source support discipline.
5. Health data privacy and provenance boundaries.
6. Source claim review queue for Turkish medical language model examples.

This does not claim official status, program participation, regulatory access, sandbox access, or institutional endorsement.

## Track B value

For global open source medical AI evaluation, this public preview gives:

1. A reusable failure taxonomy.
2. A synthetic intake contract.
3. A generated review queue.
4. A SourceCheckup contribution path.
5. A no ranking report path.
6. A visible foundation for collaboration with benchmark and model builder communities.
7. A source claim review queue that separates citation presence from evidence support.

This does not claim benchmark equivalence, clinical validation, or model superiority.

## Next public build gates

1. Health data quality card for synthetic dataset release readiness.
2. MedHELM and Medmarks compatibility notes with strict wording.
3. Additional Turkish risk rows for specialty spread.
4. Assurance card template for medical language model releases.
