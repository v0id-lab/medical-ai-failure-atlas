## Current routing decision

The right next move is still build and wait:

1. Do not push a new public GitHub comment today.
2. Do not ask for review again on open upstream pull requests.
3. Keep LinkedIn visibility separate from GitHub maintainer pressure.
4. Use issue 154 only when asking for a narrow outside objection.
5. Recheck all public routes before any future public claim.
