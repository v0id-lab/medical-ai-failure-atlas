# Medical AI Safety Field Kit One Objection Gateway

Date: 2026 06 20

Status: public gateway for one outside reviewer action.

## Purpose

The whole ask is one objection.

Pick one role. Pick one lane. Leave one bounded objection that names a risk, a missing gate, and safer wording.

This gateway is the first link for clinicians, health informatics reviewers, Turkish medical language reviewers, source support reviewers, governance reviewers, and open model maintainers who want to help without reading the full project first.

## Two Minute Action

Open the main intake:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/issues/154

If you only have one sentence, put it there. The maintainer will route useful objections into the right card or gate.

Or pick a specialist lane below.

Use this shape:

```text

Lane:
Risk:
Missing gate:
Safer wording:
```

## Choose One Lane

1. Synthetic evidence reviewer

Go here:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/issues/154

Attack this: a synthetic card is mistaken for evidence.

2. Clinician reviewer

Go here:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/issues/152

Attack this: demo success starts to sound like hospital readiness.

3. Turkish medical language reviewer

Go here:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/issues/151

Attack this: Turkish clinical wording changes urgency, certainty, action boundary, or responsibility.

4. Source support reviewer

Go here:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/issues/150

Attack this: a public source link is treated as support for a stronger claim than it can carry.

5. Governance wording reviewer

Go here:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/blob/main/docs/MEDICAL_AI_SAFETY_FIELD_KIT_GLOBAL_SAFETY_CLAIM_REVIEW_WORKBOOK_20260620.md

Attack this: wording sounds like approval, readiness, safety proof, or deployment permission.

6. Open model or benchmark maintainer

Go here:

https://github.com/v0id-lab/medical-ai-failure-atlas/blob/main/docs/MEDICAL_AI_SAFETY_FIELD_KIT_EXTERNAL_ROUTE_SCOUT_BOARD_20260620.md

Attack this: a benchmark or leaderboard result is being used as a safety claim.

## Good Objection

```text
Role:
Lane:
Risk:
Missing gate:
Safer wording:
```

Example shape:

```text
Role: Turkish medical language reviewer
Lane: SFC003
Risk: The wording makes a review prompt sound like patient direction.
Missing gate: It does not say this is a synthetic language review example.
Safer wording: This wording should be treated as a language safety check, not as clinical advice.
```

## Maintainer Rule

1. Count only outside comments as outside review.
2. Convert useful objections into clearer cards or workbook gates.
3. If a comment names a real patient case, stop and remove the route risk.
4. If a comment claims validation, deployment, approval, partnership, or institutional support, ask for safer wording.
5. Do not turn a synthetic example into evidence.

## Public Boundary

Use synthetic or public examples only.

Do not include patient data, private clinical text, raw private model output, diagnosis advice, treatment advice, clinical validation, clinical deployment, benchmark ranking, score certification, source truth certification, partner claim, institution claim, endorsement, formal application, payment, terms action, budget action, procurement claim, or official role claim.

## Done Condition

This gateway succeeds when one outside reviewer leaves one bounded objection with a missing gate and safer wording.
