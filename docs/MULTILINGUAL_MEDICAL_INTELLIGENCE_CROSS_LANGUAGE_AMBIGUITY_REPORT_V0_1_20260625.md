# Multilingual Medical Intelligence Cross Language Ambiguity Controls v0.1

Date: 2026 06 25

Status: ready for local repo review only

## Purpose

This report checks whether English and Turkish ASCII variants keep the same uncertainty, missing data, source support, action boundary, and translation review boundary.

It blocks cross language ambiguity when one language adds certainty, weakens source support, softens missing data, shifts action boundary, or removes translation review.

The controls use synthetic rows only. They contain no patient data and make no diagnosis, treatment instruction, clinical validation, clinical deployment, model ranking, partner, or institutional claim.

## Score Summary

1. Control rows: 12.
2. Expected pass controls: 6.
3. Expected fail controls: 6.
4. Observed pass controls: 6.
5. Observed blocked controls: 6.
6. Source candidate coverage count: 6.
7. Source row coverage count: 6.

## Cross Language Signal Counts

1. `english_added_certainty`: declared 1, detected 1.
2. `turkish_added_certainty`: declared 1, detected 1.
3. `source_support_shift`: declared 1, detected 1.
4. `missing_data_softened`: declared 1, detected 1.
5. `action_boundary_shifted`: declared 1, detected 1.
6. `translation_review_removed`: declared 1, detected 1.

## Reviewer Triage

Does either language variant add certainty, weaken source support, soften missing data, shift action boundary, or remove translation review.

Triage order:

1. `action_boundary_shifted`
2. `translation_review_removed`
3. `source_support_shift`
4. `missing_data_softened`
5. `english_added_certainty`
6. `turkish_added_certainty`

## Release Boundary

This report supports repo local review only. It does not clear text for patient care, clinical advice, translation clearance, clinical validation, clinical deployment, model comparison, institutional use, or external publication.

Boundary note: not score certification, not source truth certification, not clinical validation, not clinical deployment, not translation clearance, and not external publication clearance.

## Validation Command

`make multilingual_medical_intelligence_cross_language_ambiguity_controls`

Direct check:

`python3 scripts/score_multilingual_medical_intelligence_cross_language_ambiguity_controls_v0_1_20260625.py --check`

## Exact Next Action

Add cross language source conflict and provenance controls so translated variants preserve source conflict status, source version, and provenance chain before public reuse.
