### 1. CMIPU001

Source: TÜBİTAK 1711 Yapay Zekâ Ekosistem 2026 announcement

Source date: 16 June 2026

Observed claim: The fifth 1711 call opened on 15 June 2026, lists five 2026 priority areas, and receives applications through PRODİS.

Portfolio impact: Keep the 1711 readiness packet active but do not claim a health priority route because health is not listed among the five stated 2026 areas.

Decision lock: Any application, partner, non medical pivot, terms step, budget step, or submission needs Dr. Ozkan clearance.

### 2. CMIPU002

Source: Ankara İl Sağlık Müdürlüğü AI studies ethics page

Source date: 30 January 2026

Observed claim: The page says AI related studies presented to that ethics committee will be suspended until new regulation.

Portfolio impact: Add a Türkiye ethics status verification gate before any ethics, clinical study, deployment, or validation claim.

Decision lock: Do not generalize this local page into a national rule without separate verification.

### 3. CMIPU003

Source: Sağlık Bilgi Sistemleri Genel Müdürlüğü Yapay Zekâ ve Yenilikçi Teknolojiler Daire Başkanlığı page

Source date: 21 August 2024

Observed claim: The page lists tasks including identifying AI improvable processes, producing or procuring AI solutions, following AI technologies, building stakeholder collaborations, interoperability, and education materials.

Portfolio impact: Track A should emphasize assurance lab, clinician literacy, interoperability, and education surfaces without claiming official role or endorsement.

Decision lock: No ministry role, route access, or endorsement claim without explicit verified authorization.

### 4. CMIPU004

Source: OpenAI HealthBench public page

Source date: 2025

Observed claim: HealthBench describes realistic health conversations, physician expert rubrics, 262 physicians, 60 countries, and 5000 conversations.

Portfolio impact: Track B should keep building clinician rubric literacy, reviewer question fields, and no ranking safety reports without claiming benchmark compatibility.

Decision lock: No HealthBench compatibility, score, or benchmark equivalence claim without explicit benchmark owner aligned validation.

### 5. CMIPU005

Source: MedHELM public site

Source date: 2026

Observed claim: MedHELM presents an open community benchmark with 121 clinical tasks, 22 subcategories, 31 datasets, 5 categories, and measures including accuracy, calibration, robustness, and writing style.

Portfolio impact: Track B should add benchmark compatibility notes that explain what local synthetic artifacts can and cannot map to.

Decision lock: No MedHELM compatibility, leaderboard, model comparison, or clinical workflow deployment claim.

### 6. CMIPU006

Source: Google MedGemma Health AI Developer Foundations page

Source date: 2026

Observed claim: The page describes MedGemma models for medical text and image comprehension and states that use cases require validation.

Portfolio impact: Add open model boundary notes that separate model availability from local clinical validation or deployment readiness.

Decision lock: No model run, endpoint use, terms acceptance, clinical validation, or deployment claim without clearance.

### 7. CMIPU007

Source: European Commission AI in healthcare page

Source date: 2026

Observed claim: The page says the EU AI Act entered into force on 1 August 2024 and high risk AI systems such as AI based software intended for medical purposes must meet requirements including risk mitigation, data quality, user information, and human oversight.

Portfolio impact: Track A and Track B should keep no deployment and no regulatory claim language, while adding risk management and human oversight checklist fields.

Decision lock: No EU compliance, conformity, or regulatory readiness claim without legal and product scope review.

### 8. CMIPU008

Source: FDA AI Enabled Medical Devices page

Source date: 2026

Observed claim: The page says the FDA AI Enabled Medical Device List identifies authorized marketed AI enabled devices and is updated periodically.

Portfolio impact: Track B should add transparent boundary wording that public evaluation tools are not devices, not marketing submissions, and not authorization claims.

Decision lock: No FDA authorization, device, SaMD, or marketing claim without formal regulatory scope review.
