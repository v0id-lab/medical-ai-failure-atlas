# SourceCheckup source claim example expansion v0.2

Status: generated public preview.

This dashboard summarizes the expanded synthetic SourceCheckup example set, contributor examples, and source claim review queue.

It uses synthetic examples only. It is not clinical advice, not patient data, not clinical deployment, not clinical validation, not a model safety claim, not a model ranking, not source truth certification, and not an official endorsement.

## Track A value

1. Adds Turkish medical LLM source discipline examples for medication safety, benchmark wording, national route wording, and data provenance.
2. Keeps official route, sandbox, patient data, and clinical deployment claims blocked unless exact written evidence exists.
3. Gives clinician literacy and assurance lab modules concrete source claim exercises.
4. Routes the source claim queue into the SourceCheckup TR MedLLM assurance routing map.
5. Sends medication safety and policy wording routes into the source review worksheets.
6. Sends red flag locator and warning sign wording routes into the red flag contributor examples.

## Track B value

1. Expands SourceCheckup Medical from a parser preview into a public source review queue surface.
2. Links source support, benchmark compatibility wording, Failure Atlas rows, and health data quality boundaries.
3. Keeps source review separate from source truth certification, model ranking, and clinical validation.
4. Adds a bridge into `docs/SOURCECHECKUP_TR_MEDLLM_ASSURANCE_ROUTING_MAP_V0_1.md`.
5. Adds a bridge into `docs/SOURCE_REVIEW_WORKSHEETS_V0_1.md`.
6. Adds a bridge into `docs/RED_FLAG_WARNING_CHECKLIST_V0_1.md` for red flag source locator review.
7. Adds a bridge into `docs/sourcecheckup/RED_FLAG_SOURCE_LOCATOR_CONTRIBUTOR_EXAMPLES_V0_1.md`.

## Boundary checks

1. Every example is synthetic.
2. Patient data is not used.
3. External action readiness is false for review queue rows.
4. Outward use is not allowed until maintainer review and exact source support checks are complete.
5. Passing local SourceCheckup only means no local source claim risk was triggered.
6. This dashboard does not certify any source, guideline, policy, benchmark, or medical claim.
