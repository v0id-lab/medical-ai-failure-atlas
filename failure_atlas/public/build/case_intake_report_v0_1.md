# Failure Atlas case intake report v0.1

Status: generated public preview.

This report is generated from the public Failure Atlas intake rows and the TR MedLLM synthetic risk pack.

It uses synthetic examples only. It is not clinical advice, not patient data, not clinical deployment, not clinical validation, not a model safety claim, and not an institutional endorsement.
